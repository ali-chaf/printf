Printf Replica Project
Overview
The Printf Replica Project is a C programming project aimed at creating a simplified replica of the standard C library function printf. printf is a powerful and versatile function used for formatted output in C and C++ programs. This project serves as an educational exercise to understand the inner workings of printf and gain a deeper insight into the mechanics of variadic functions and string formatting.
Project Features
Basic Formatting: The project includes support for basic formatting specifiers such as %c (character), %s (string), %d (integer), %f (floating-point), and %x (hexadecimal).

Variable Arguments: It demonstrates how to handle a variable number of arguments using the va_list, va_start, and va_arg macros.

String Parsing: The project parses the format string and processes each format specifier, ensuring correct data type matching between the format string and arguments.

Custom Specifiers: It allows you to define custom format specifiers to extend the functionality of your printf replica.
